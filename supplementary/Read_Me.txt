Description
    The input and the output speech signals are attached for researchers and readers, so a person can play back the speech signals whose spectrograms are depicted in the article. The input signals are transmitted by the speaker(s), and the output signals demonstrate the quality of the extracted features received at the end of the Automatic Speech Recognition. Figures 1a and 5a correspond to the input files whose initials are E0* and T0* respectively. E1* is the reconstructed speech signal. E2* is three reconstructions of three fundamental frequency ranges. E3* is two reconstructions of tuned feature extraction. T1a* and T1c* correspond to Figure 6f left and right, respectively. The intermediate between the two is T1b*, which corresponds to the transform in Figure 4. Moreover, T2a0*, T2b0*, and T2c0* correspond to the Figure 7 a, b, and c. Applying 8-level quantization on the harmonic spectrum of T2b0* and T2c0* yields T2b1* and T2c1*, respectively. The T2c0* is also provided with four additional files: T2c2 and T2c3 are obtained using filtering, while T2c4 and T2c5 are obtained tuning the speech feature extraction to specific frequency ranges. In the tuning cases, the speech of the target range is received in higher quality than the speech that is outside the target range.
